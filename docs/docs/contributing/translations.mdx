## Translation Guidelines

For the time being, we're not using any third party translation platform such as crowdin.

In order to be able to support us with new languages, exotic typos or maintaining existing translation, you can refer to our GitHub repo, and following the tree based translation structure.

# What is i18n?

## i18n folder structure


<CodeBlock className="language-bash">{treeDumpI18n}</CodeBlock>



## i18n Translations

There's one way to translate content in easyjwt documentation

### Translating string or specific code block

Update the file i18n/`[language]`/code.json. Here's below an example of `code.json` file:

<CodeBlock className="language-json">
{codeJsonSample}
</CodeBlock>

Every translation is based on english documentation markdown.x structure and generated as translated markdown(x) files in the right folder following metadata from `i18n-meta` folder.
