## Translation Guidelines

For the time being, we're not using any third party translation platform such as crowdin.

In order to be able to support us with new languages, exotic typos or maintaining existing translation, you can refer to our GitHub repo, and following the tree based translation structure.

## i18n Translations

There're two ways to translate content in easyjwt documentation

### Translating string or specific code block

Update the file i18n/`[language]`/code.json. Here's below an example of `code.json` file:

<CodeBlock className="language-json">
{codeJsonSample}
</CodeBlock>

### Translating an entire markdown file

Update the markdown file located under i18n/`[language]`/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/`[markdownFile.md(x)]`.

The translated markdown file will be located under the same structure as the original md(x) to be translated.

For instance `installation.mdx` located in `docs/introduction/installations.mdx`, will have its translation located in i18n/`[language]`/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/introduction/installation.mdx.

If the file doesn't exist, then you'll need to create it for the corresponding language, if it's doesn't exist for the deployed version, the language displayed will be the default one (e.g.: text in english for a french page with missing french translation).
