What's easyjwt?
</Translate>

<Translate id="introduction.what-is-easyjwt.genesis">
"easyjwt" (ee·zee·jot), is a library wrapping common security tools and libraries to simplify the generation and validation of JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWT.
</Translate>

<br />
<br />


<Translate id="introduction.what-is-easyjwt.why">
It has been created to overcome some existing librairies' limitations, historically to support validation of jwt generated with a jwk, hosted locally with a self-signed certificate.
</Translate>

<br />
<br />


<Translate id="introduction.what-is-easyjwt.another-why">
Another motivation of easyjwt was the lack of simplicity felt using other librairies. Its goal is to provide a minimal set of functions to generate a token and validate a token, whatever the algorithm used to create the token was.

<Translate id="introduction.what-is-easyjwt.note-token">
easyjwt is a library used to generate and validate web tokens, once a token is generated, you need to ensure its isolation and preventing any exposition.
Various implementations of easyjwt will be available on Authdog's official GitHub organization.
