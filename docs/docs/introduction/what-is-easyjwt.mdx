What's easyjwt?
</Translate>
</h1>

"*easyjwt*" (ee·zee·jot), is a library wrapping common security tools and libraries to simplify the generation and validation of JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWT.

It has been created to overcome some existing librairies' limitations, historically to support validation of jwt generated with a jwk, hosted locally with a self-signed certificate.

Another motivation of easyjwt was the lack of simplicity felt using other librairies. Its goal is to provide a minimal set of functions to generate a token and validate a token, whatever the algorithm used to create the token was.

:::info

*easyjwt* is a library used to generate and validate web tokens, once a token is generated, you need to ensure its isolation and preventing any exposition.
Various implementations of easyjwt will be available on Authdog's official GitHub organization.
